# Python Basics

- Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- Use `print()` to display output.
- Indentation is important in Python â€” it defines code blocks.
- Variables are dynamically typed (no need to declare the type).
- Example:

```python
name = "William"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
